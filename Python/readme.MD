# IMDb Rating-Based Collection Sorter

## The Why

This project was conceived during 2016 when I had a good internet connection but no good streaming services available, compared to today.
I had a big collection of movies to watch, but no way to determine which were the good ones.
Hence, this project helps to identify the good movies and the bad ones easily.

## The What

This script organizes your movies into folders according to their IMDb rating.

## The How

Uses the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com/) to get the rating and accurate movie name from the remote database.
